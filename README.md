# Training Monitor
A simple collection of scripts to analyze the performances of an athlete.
The scripts compares the performances of common sections in all the tracks being loaded.
It is possible to arbitrarily define the common sections isolating the initial and final GPS points in the tracks.
This is similar to some already existing features in common fitness apps, but it is free (for now 😁)
